## Tools

### Next.js
Next was chosen as the framework of choice because it offers great server-side-rendering and an overall great development experience with module hot reloading and great integration with https://now.sh. That makes deployments and staging are a breeze. The persistant, immutable staging links really come in handy for making rapid iterations for clients to approve.

### Styled-Components
Although the css-in-js solution that comes pre-packaged with next.js (styled-jsx) is a great tool, I prefer the syntax of styled-components and nesting rules is a great value add.

### Typescript
Typescript was used because it rules. The typehints and refactoring super powers make it a joy to work with _chef kiss_
